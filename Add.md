# git add

When changes have been made inside a git repository that you want to keep, you'll need to use the `git add` command.

Items that have not bee "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified.

Generally, you gan get away with the command `git add .` which will add ALL fiules and directories that erer added, changed, or deleted.

you can track changes to specific files using `git add file1 file2` which will track specifically file 1 and file 2.

You can specify tracking directories with `git add DirectoryName`.
